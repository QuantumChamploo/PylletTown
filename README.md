Current build has a mini game "Walls and Fireballs" were you defeat evil Maxs, an overworld based on Pokemons pallet town (obvi). Also prototypes for menu based fighting

Alpha implementation is running the 'Game.py' script in the pylletTown-master folder. The only dependency is upon pygame. The dev "team" is currently working on a proper app distribution.
